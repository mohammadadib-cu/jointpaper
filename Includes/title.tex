\begin{abstract}
Time-resolved measurements of gaseous species and carbon black (CB) were conducted during the pyrolysis of 5\% $\mathrm{CH_4}$ in Ar at post-reflected-shock pressures near $5$~atm over a temperature range of $1800$â€“$2400$~K, to better understand the carbon conversion flux from $\mathrm{CH_4}$ to gaseous intermediates and solid carbonaceous particles. Soot morphology was characterized using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) across the studied temperature range. An imposed-pressure reactor model, coupled with detailed chemistry and a sectional population balance model (SPBM), was employed to simulate CB formation and growth. Simulations using the Caltech mechanism accurately predicted the $\mathrm{CH_4}$ conversion rate but underpredicted the carbon mass in acetylene ($\mathrm{C_2H_2}$) and overpredicted that in ethylene ($\mathrm{C_2H_4}$). The inception flux was identified as the primary factor influencing model predictions of soot volume fraction ($f_v$) and mean primary particle diameter ($d_p$). The model accounts for CB carbonization, which alters particle composition (H/C ratio) and surface reactivity. Carbonization rates, adjusted using the ratio of extinction measurements at $632$~nm and $1064$~nm, enabled the model to reproduce the time histories of CB volume fraction and $d_p$ in good agreement with TEM measurements.
